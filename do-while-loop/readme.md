# Do-While Loop Practice

## Number Guessing Game:

Create a number guessing game where the program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess it. The loop continues until the correct guess is made.

## Input Validation Loop:

Write a program that continues to ask the user for a positive integer and validates the input. The loop should only terminate when a valid number is entered.

## Reverse a Number:

Implement a program that reverses the digits of a number entered by the user using a do-while loop.

## Compute Compound Interest:

Write a program that calculates the compound interest for a given principal, rate, and time period. The loop should ask if the user wants to calculate again and continue until they choose not to.

## Palindrome Number Checker:

Create a program that checks whether a number entered by the user is a palindrome.
