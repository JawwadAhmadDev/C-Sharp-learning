# Problem Statements for Abstraction

## Banking System:

Create an abstract class BankAccount that represents a generic bank account. Define abstract methods for basic operations like deposit(), withdraw(), and calculateInterest(). Implement specific account types such as SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount by extending BankAccount.

## Shapes Drawing Application:

Define an abstract class Shape with an abstract method draw(). Implement different shape classes like Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle that inherit from Shape and provide specific implementations of the draw() method.

## Employee Management System:

Design an abstract class Employee with common fields like name and ID, and an abstract method for calculating salary. Create specific classes like FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee that inherit from Employee and implement the salary calculation method differently.

## Vehicle Control System:

Develop an abstract class Vehicle with abstract methods such as startEngine(), stopEngine(), accelerate(), and brake(). Different vehicle types like Car, Truck, and Motorcycle should inherit from Vehicle and provide specific implementations for these methods.

## Smart Device Interface:

Create an abstract class SmartDevice representing a generic smart device with abstract methods like turnOn(), turnOff(), and updateFirmware(). Different specific devices like SmartPhone, SmartWatch, and SmartTV can inherit from this class and implement these methods.
