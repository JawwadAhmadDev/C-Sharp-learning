# Nested If Problem Statements.

## Academic Eligibility for Scholarship:

Write a program to determine if a student is eligible for a scholarship based on academic performance. If the student's GPA is greater than or equal to 3.5, check if they have participated in more than 3 extracurricular activities. If both conditions are true, confirm their eligibility.

## Restaurant Health and Safety Inspection:

Implement a program for a health and safety inspection at a restaurant. If the restaurant has passed the basic hygiene test, check if their kitchen equipment is up to the standard. If the kitchen equipment also passes the check, then further check if the staff has valid health certificates. Only if all these conditions are met, the restaurant passes the inspection.

## Customized Travel Recommendations:

Create a program that offers travel recommendations based on user preferences. If the user prefers outdoor activities, check if they like hiking. If they do, suggest a mountain destination. Within the mountain destination, if the user also prefers cold weather, suggest a mountainous region with a colder climate.

## Home Loan Eligibility:

Write a program to assess eligibility for a home loan. If the applicant has a steady job, then check if they have been in their current job for more than two years. If they have, further check if they have a credit score above 700. Only if all these conditions are met, the applicant is eligible for the loan.

## Personalized Online Shopping Experience:

Implement a program for an online shopping platform that personalizes the shopping experience. If a user is browsing in the electronics section, check if they spend more than 5 minutes on smartphone products. If yes, display special offers on smartphones. Within this condition, if the user frequently views a particular brand, show offers specifically for that brand.
